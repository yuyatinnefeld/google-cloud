### Explore ecommerce data

```sql

# define visitors
WITH visitors AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_visitors
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
),

# define purchases
purchasers AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_purchasers
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
WHERE totals.transactions IS NOT NULL
)

# choose 2 values + CVR
SELECT
  total_visitors,
  total_purchasers,
  total_purchasers / total_visitors AS conversion_rate
FROM visitors, purchasers
```

check top 5 selling products
```sql
SELECT
  p.v2ProductName,
  p.v2ProductCategory,
  SUM(p.productQuantity) AS units_sold,
  ROUND(SUM(p.localProductRevenue/1000000),2) AS revenue
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
UNNEST(hits) AS h,
UNNEST(h.product) AS p
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

show the returning visitors who already bought more than once
```sql
WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid, # 741,721 unique visitors
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorid) AS total_visitors,
  will_buy_on_return_visit
FROM all_visitor_stats
GROUP BY will_buy_on_return_visit
```

## Select features and create your training dataset

```sql
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1)
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
ORDER BY time_on_site DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## create a BigQuery dataset to store models
- Dataset ID: ecommerce
```bash
bq mk ecommerce
```
## Select a BigQuery ML model type
- Model: logistic_reg

### Create classification_model
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model`
OPTIONS
(
model_type='logistic_reg',
labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
)
AS

#standardSQL
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
;
```

### check the model
ecommerce.classification_model

## Evaluate the model performance
- In BigQuery ML, roc_auc is simply a queryable field when evaluating your trained ML model.

```sql
SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model,  (

SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630') # eval on 2 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)

));
```

## improve model performance

### create the next model (classification_model_2)

- add some new features:
    - traffic source
    - device category
    - geo info


```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model_2`
OPTIONS
  (model_type='logistic_reg', labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']) AS

SELECT
  fullvisitorid,
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

# add in new features
SELECT * EXCEPT(unique_session_id) FROM (

  SELECT
      CONCAT(fullvisitorid, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,

      # labels

      trafficSource.source,
      trafficSource.medium,
      channelGrouping,

      # mobile or desktop
      device.deviceCategory,

      IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country

  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
     UNNEST(hits) AS h

    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)

  WHERE 1=1
    # only predict for new visits
    AND totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430' # train 9 months

  GROUP BY

## Predict which new visitors will come back and purchase
