# BigQuery ML

BigQuery ML supports a variety of machine learning models and a complete machine learning flow for each model, such as feature preprocessing, model creation, hyperparameter tuning, inference, evaluation, model export and so on. The machine learning flow for the models are split into the following two tables: 

- Model Creation Phase
- Model Use Phase
